    <li><h2>Summary<h2></li>
    <p>I'm a 39-year-old professional with a Master's degree in Finance
     from a university in Ukraine. I began my career in banking and eventually
     became the Manager of the Corporate Loan Office. In 2010, I moved to the USA,
     where I predominantly worked in sales roles. Programming has always been a
     lifelong hobby and passion of mine, and now I've decided to make a complete 
     career change into this field.</p>
